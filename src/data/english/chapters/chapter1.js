    People need banks and financial institutions to meet their savings, credit, investment, transactions, and other financial needs. People would like to protect themselves against losses by taking insurance. Business persons would like to seek capital for business through credit from banks. These requirements are met by banks, insurance companies, financial institutions, and others.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-3">
    As per section 5 (b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, banking is defined as “accepting” for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawal by cheque, draft, and order or “otherwise”. As per section 5 (c) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, it is defined that “a banking company is a company which transacts the business of banking in India”.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-3">
    Banks accept money from the public in the form of deposits. It is necessary that deposits are safe and returned as per terms of acceptance or when demanded by the depositor. To ensure this, banks carry on their business in a professional and safe manner. They take due care of monies accepted in the form of deposits. They lend money for various purposes. Banks are also involved in handling and putting through transactions on behalf of their customers and others. In order that banks function in an orderly manner and that depositors are protected, banking and financial institutions are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India.

    { id: '1.3', title: '	FEATURES OF BANKING', content: `<p class="mb-3">The following are the basic characteristics or the essential features of Banking:</p>

    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: red;">Dealing in Money: Banks accept deposits from the public and provide the same as loans to the needy people. Banks also invest the money in various financial instruments.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: red;">Accepting Deposits: Deposits could be in the form of current, savings and fixed/term deposit accounts. Deposits are accepted for various periods subject to certain terms and conditions. Savings and current accounts are transaction accounts. Current and Savings account deposits are withdrawable by the account holder/customer by cheques, electronic transactions, etc. For this purpose, banks issue cheques, ATM cards or ATM cum Debit Cards and allow transactions through mobile banking. The deposits are usually withdrawable on demand i.e. by presenting the cheque with the branch or putting through the transaction.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: red;">Sanctioning and issuing loans and advances: Banks lend for various purposes. Loans could be in the form of cash credit, overdraft, term loans, bills discounting, letter of credit, etc. Loans are for specified periods. Banks charge interest and other fees/charges on loans.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: red;">Creating Money/Credit: Money lent by the bank will be used in business and will be deposited by the recipient into the banking system. This creates a fresh chain of deposits and credit i.e., it ends up creating fresh credit. Thus, banks can create credit i.e., creation of additional money for lending. This is a unique feature of banking.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: red;">Nature of Agent: Besides the basic function of accepting deposits and lending money as loans, banks possess the character of an agent because of its various features of banking.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mb-3">Though banks offer many services by nature of business, they are commercial in nature: They are ‘for profit’ organizations. Since all the banking functions are carried on with the objective of earning interest or fee or commission i.e. Making profit, they are regarded as commercial institutions.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">Following is a pictorial view of the bank's products.</p>

    <img src="path_to_image.jpg" alt="Bank Products" class="img-fluid mb-3"/>
    
    <p class="mb-3">An economy consists of savers of money and users of money. Banks accept money from the savers and lend or invest it with the users. This is the most important role of banks. Savers of money could be individuals, insurance policy holders, investors, firms, organizations, businesses, industries, etc. They keep money invested in banks and other financial institutions. Users are those who borrow money from banks and financial institutions for their personal or carrying out an economic activity like farming or manufacturing and/or business requirements.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">Banks are part of the financial system of the country. The financial system consists of banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, and others.</p>

    {image-- Chart. Indian Banking and Financial System}
    
    <p>Commercial banks are formed in the form of a company. As indicated earlier, these institutions accept deposits, issue loans and offer payment and settlement support to the business people and the public. These are a variety of commercial banks in India. However, all of them adopt a branch banking model i.e. the banks operate through their branches situated in various places in India. Nowadays, branches and Head office of the bank are well connected through the core banking system and therefore, a customer of a bank can, subject to certain conditions, operate her/his/their account(s) from any of the branches. Typically, each commercial bank has a head office, zonal or regional officers, and several branches. These institutions are “for profit” organizations.</p>
    
    <p>Commercial banks in India are broadly classified as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Public Sector Banks</li>
        <li>Private Sector Banks</li>
        <li>Foreign Banks</li>
        <li>Small Finance Banks</li>
        <li>Local Area Banks</li>
        <li>Payments Banks</li>
        <li>Regional Rural Banks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Public Sector Banks</h2>
    <p>These include State Bank of India and 11 other banks which are owned by GOI (majority stake with GOI) and whose shares are also listed in the market. As indicated earlier, between 1969 and 1980, about 20 private banks were nationalized with the objective of using bank funds for the purpose of economic development. Subsequently, the Government of India divested a portion of its share in the market and the majority of PSU banks were listed in the stock market. Recently on account of financial stability norms, some of these banks have been merged in a process of consolidation. In view of this, there are currently 11 PSU banks and SBI. SBI is the largest bank of the country with a balance sheet size of over around Rs 110 Lakh crore (as of March 2023).</p>
    
    <h2>Private Sector Banks</h2>
    <p>Private sector banks are those whose equity is held by private shareholders and the government does not own any share capital or may be a minor shareholder. Some of the private banks have come into existence after 1990. There are 21 private sector banks in India. HDFC bank is the largest private bank. These banks are better capitalized, technology-driven, aggressive in business development, and adopt a style of functioning comparable to foreign banks operating in India. These banks adopt a variety of delivery channels.</p>
    
    <h2>Foreign Banks</h2>
    <p>Foreign banks are commercial banks that are registered in foreign countries but doing business in India. While there are many foreign banks operating in India, their branch network is smaller and most of them operate in metropolitan cities and State Capitals. Their operations are technology-driven and a good part of their business comprises corporate banking, foreign exchange, export/import finance, and merchant banking.</p>
    
    <h2>Small Finance Banks</h2>
    <p>Small Finance banks (SFB) have come into being from 2015 after licensing norms were issued by RBI. The SFBs are expected to function with an objective of achieving financial inclusion by offering basic banking activities to under-served sections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries, and unorganized entities. These banks can accept deposits, issue loans and advances, and offer other services to their customers. There are certain restrictions on the products and services they can offer. They cannot do all activities like a full-fledged commercial bank. As per RBI guidelines, they are required to extend 75 percent of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors eligible for classification as priority sector lending (PSL) by RBI. Further, in order to ensure that the bank extends loans primarily to small borrowers, at least 50 percent of its loan portfolio should constitute loans and advances of up to Rs 25 lakh.</p>
    
    <h2>Payments Banks</h2>
    <p>A payments bank is a bank with restricted or limited functions. It can accept deposits and do transactions (remittances and payments) and other services but cannot grant loans and advances or handle credit. Whereas there is no limit on the amount of deposit, or the type of deposit accepted from individuals and others by other banks, payment banks cannot accept deposits of more than Rs.2 lakh. They are allowed to provide only demand deposits (i.e., current and savings account) and not term deposits. In essence, these banks have the objective of being focused on payments and settlements. These banks can offer remittance services, mobile payments/transfers/purchases, and other banking services like ATM/debit cards, net banking, and third-party fund transfers. They cannot issue Credit Cards. The list of payments banks in India are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Airtel Payments Bank Ltd.</li>
        <li>India Post Payment Bank Ltd.</li>
        <li>FINO Payments Bank Ltd.</li>
        <li>Paytm Payments Bank Ltd.</li>
        <li>Jio Payments Bank Ltd.</li>
        <li>NSDL Payments Bank Ltd.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)</h2>
    <p>Regional rural banks (RRBs) cater to the basic banking and credit needs of people in rural and semi-urban areas such as small farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans, and MSMEs. These banks are jointly owned by the Government of India (50%), the State Government concerned (15%), and the sponsoring bank. Due to consolidation, the number of RRBs has reduced. The main objective of an RRBs is to develop the rural economy. Their borrowers include small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans, etc. Agricultural lending constitutes around 70 percent of total loans and advances of these banks. There are 43 Regional RRBs in India as of December 31, 2022.</p>
    
    <h2>Local Area Banks</h2>
    <p>Local Area Banks (LABs) were licensed with the objective of mobilizing rural savings and strengthening institutional credit mechanisms in local areas. These banks have a small area of operation of three districts. As of March 2022, only two LABs were operational in the country as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coastal Local Area Bank (Operating in A.P.)</li>
        <li>Krishna Bhima Samruthi Local Area Bank Ltd. (at present operating in Telangana, Andhra and Karnataka)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Co-Operative Banks</h3>
<p>Co-operative banks in India have become an integral part of the success of the Indian financial inclusion story. Co-operative banks work on the principle of cooperation and mutual help. Unlike commercial banks, these are not companies but are registered under the Co-operative Societies Act. A cooperative society/bank is owned by its members.</p>

<p>The structure of the cooperative network in India can be divided into two broad segments:</p>

<h4>(a) Urban Co-operative Banks:</h4>
<p>Urban Co-operative banks can be divided into scheduled and non-scheduled categories. Both categories are further divided into multi-state and single-state banks. Many of these banks fall into the non-scheduled and single-state category. Banking activities of Urban Co-operative banks are monitored by the RBI. Registration and management activities are handled by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. These RCSs operate in a single state and Central RCS operates in multiple states.</p>

<h4>(b) Rural Co-operatives:</h4>
<p>The Rural Cooperative can be divided into short-term and long-term structures. The short-term cooperative banks generally have a three-tier system operating in different states. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Co-Operative Banks:</strong> They operate at the apex level in a state.</li>
<li><strong>District Central Co-Operative Banks:</strong> They operate at the district levels.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Agricultural Credit Societies:</strong> They operate at the village or grassroots level.</li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise, the long-term structures are further divided into State Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks, which operate at the state level, and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks, which operate at a district level.</p>

<p>The Rural banking co-operatives have a complex monitoring structure as they have dual control, which has led to many problems. Various reforms have been put in place to ensure that these institutions are run and managed on professional lines.</p>

<p>At present, all banking activities of co-operative banks are regulated by a shared arrangement between the RBI and NABARD. All management and registration activities are managed by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies of the state.</p>
